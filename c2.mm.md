# The Nature of Insurance — Study Guide (C2)

## 1. Overview
- Purpose: To understand the nature of insurance and its relationship to risk management.
- Insurance evolved to minimize the adverse effects of uncertainty and potential financial loss.
- This chapter focuses on:
  - The nature and principle of insurance.
  - Perils, losses, and hazards.
  - Risk and methods of managing risk.

## 2. The Nature of Insurance
- **Definition**
  - A legal contract transferring the risk of financial loss from an individual or business to an insurer in exchange for a premium.
- **Risk Transfer**
  - The insured pays a small, predictable premium to the insurer.
  - The insurer assumes the large, unpredictable risk of loss.
- **Risk Pooling**
  - Insurance spreads risk across a group of policyholders who share similar exposure units.
- **Principle of Indemnity**
  - Insurance restores the insured to their original financial position after a loss.
  - The insured cannot profit or gain financially from a covered loss.
  - Indemnity:
    - The financial amount needed to restore the insured.
    - Indemnify: The act of restoring financial status.
- **Law of Large Numbers**
  - The larger the number of similar exposure units, the more accurate the prediction of losses.
  - Used by actuaries to predict claims and set premiums.
- **Adverse Selection**
  - The tendency for higher-risk individuals to seek or maintain insurance more often than lower-risk individuals.
  - Controlled by sound underwriting and risk classification.

## 3. Perils, Loss, and Hazards

### A. Perils
- Definition: The immediate and specific cause of a loss.
- **Types of Coverage:**
  - **Named (Specified) Perils:** Only the listed perils are covered.
  - **Open (Special) Perils:** Covers all causes of loss except those specifically excluded.

### B. Loss
- Definition: The unintentional financial decrease in value of an asset due to a peril.
- **Occurrence:**
  - The event that causes a loss; may occur suddenly or over time.
- **Accident:**
  - A specific, unexpected event causing measurable loss at a specific time and place.
- **Indirect (Consequential) Loss:**
  - Results from a direct loss.
  - Example: Lost income after a fire.
- **Direct Loss:**
  - Immediate damage to property or person by a covered peril.
- **Loss Exposure:**
  - Any situation that presents the possibility of a loss.
- **Homogeneous Exposure Units:**
  - Similar insured subjects exposed to the same perils.
  - Allow insurers to apply statistical predictability for pricing.

### C. Hazards
- Definition: Conditions or behaviors that increase the likelihood or severity of a loss.
- **Types of Hazards:**
  - **Physical Hazard:**
    - Tangible condition that increases the chance of loss.
    - Example: Icy sidewalks, poor vehicle brakes.
  - **Moral Hazard:**
    - Dishonest or unethical behavior that increases risk.
    - Examples: Fraud, exaggerating claims, intentional damage.
  - **Morale Hazard:**
    - Carelessness or indifference to loss due to having insurance.
    - Example: Leaving doors unlocked because insurance covers theft.

## 4. Risk

### A. Definition
- Risk is the uncertainty regarding whether a loss will occur.
- It represents the probability of loss for an individual or entity.

### B. Types of Risk
- **Pure Risk:**
  - Involves the possibility of loss only (no gain).
  - Only type of risk that is insurable.
- **Speculative Risk:**
  - Involves both loss and potential gain.
  - Not insurable (e.g., investing in stocks).

### C. Elements of an Insurable Risk
- The loss must be:
  1. Due to chance (accidental and outside insured’s control).
  2. Definite and measurable (time, place, and amount known).
  3. Predictable and statistically calculable.
  4. Non-catastrophic (losses cannot threaten insurer solvency).
  5. Economically significant (must cause substantial financial hardship).
  6. Affordable (premium must be economically feasible).

### D. Risk Classifications
- **Preferred Risk:** Lower-than-average potential for loss.
- **Standard Risk:** Average potential for loss.
- **Substandard Risk:** Higher-than-average potential for loss.

## 5. Risk Management and Treatment

### A. Definition
- The process of identifying, analyzing, and addressing exposures to potential loss.

### B. Risk Management Strategies
1. **Risk Avoidance**
   - Eliminate exposure by not engaging in the activity.
   - Example: Not flying to avoid airplane crash risk.
2. **Risk Reduction**
   - Take action to reduce frequency or severity of losses.
   - Example: Installing safety devices or using protective equipment.
3. **Loss Prevention**
   - Type of risk reduction focused on preventing damage before it occurs.
   - Example: Fire alarms, smoke detectors.
4. **Risk Retention**
   - Accept and self-insure against certain levels of risk.
   - Example: High deductibles or setting aside funds for minor losses.
5. **Risk Transfer**
   - Shift risk to another party (basis of insurance).
   - Example: Purchasing insurance coverage.
6. **Risk Sharing (Risk Pooling or Loss Sharing)**
   - Spread the financial risk among many participants.
   - Transfers risk from the individual to a group.
7. **Reinsurance**
   - Transfer of risk between insurance companies.
   - The primary insurer (ceding company) transfers part of its risk to a reinsurer.
   - The reinsurer assumes risk in exchange for a reinsurance premium.

## 6. Key Definitions (Summary)
- **Adverse Selection:** High-risk individuals seeking insurance more often than low-risk individuals.
- **Hazard:** Condition that increases likelihood of loss.
- **Homogeneous Exposure Units:** Similar insured subjects used to calculate predictable loss.
- **Indemnity:** Restoring insured to financial position prior to loss.
- **Law of Large Numbers:** Predicts loss outcomes based on large groups.
- **Loss:** Unintended financial reduction in value.
- **Peril:** Immediate cause of loss.
- **Pure Risk:** Chance of loss only (insurable).
- **Speculative Risk:** Chance of loss or gain (not insurable).
- **Risk Transfer:** Shifting financial risk to another party.
- **Risk Retention:** Accepting and planning to pay for some risk.
- **Risk Sharing:** Distributing potential losses across a group.
- **Reinsurance:** Transferring risk between insurers.
